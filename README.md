I built a 'Pizza Value Calculator'. Sometimes it is hard to tell if a large pizza is actually a better deal than a small pizza just by looking at the total price. My project solves this problem by figuring our exactly how many Kazakh tenge you are paying for one single square centiment of pizza. It helps people see the 'hidden' real value of what they are buying. 
My solution uses HTML to create a simple layour that asks the user for their name, the pizza's size(in cm) and the total price. When the user clicks the 'Calculate' button, my JavaScript runs a function called doMath().
How the solution is worked out:
First, the code uses if statements to check if the user left the boxes empty or typed impossible numbers(like negative size or price). If they did, it stops the math and prints an error.
Then it take the size and divides it by 2 to get the radius. Then it uses the standard geometry formula for the area of a circle ( Area=3.14 * radius * radius) to find the total area of the pizza.
The next step, it divides the total price by the area to find the cost of a single square centimeter, and uses Math.round() to keep the number clean.
Finally, it uses if/else statements to judge the final price. IF it costs less than 10 tenge per cm, it calls it a cheap pizza. If it is between 10 and 15, it calls it normal. If ir is higher, ir warns the user that it is too expensive. It then glues all of this into a personalized sentence using the user's name and prints it on the screen.

Yes I used AI.
What I asked AI for: I asked AI to help me understand the basic structure of how to connect my HTML,CSS, and JavaScript files together. I also asked it how to stop the math form running is a user accidentally leaves the input boxes blank.
What I modified myself: I wrote my own simple variable names(like nameBox, pizzaSize, and doMath() so I could understand what each line was doing. I also wrote the exact if statements to catch negative numbers, set the currency to Tenge, and customized the text for the final output messages.
What I fully understand now: I now understand how JavaScript reads code. I also fully understand how to use document.getElementById().value to grab the exact number a user typed,and how to use basic if/else statements to change the final sentene based on the math result.
Reflections: This assignment showed me how to turn basic math into something visual. Applying geometry formulas like the area of a circle directly inside JS was actually a really cool way to practive the math I'm  studying for the UNT and see it used in practical way. I also learned how improtant it is to think about what the user might do wrong - like typing a negative price or leaving the name blank - and how to write simple code to catch those mistakes before they break the program.
